As you can see, I've successfully created a 'category' page (basically copy-pasting from others' work though).
And here I'm trying to upload the first picture of my website:
![5dedfb1f3a292df5e335e5c0f9315c6035a87370](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60023638/177532544-b75b6af8-8d19-4431-91c0-e7973c44867a.jpg)
