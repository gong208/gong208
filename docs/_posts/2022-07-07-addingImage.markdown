I tried to make the picture shown as part of the title of this post, which can then be displayed on homepage fo the website, and failed.
another thing worth to mention here is that, the first picture is first uploaded to the assets directory and then refered in this file. In this way, it has to be refered using a relative link. I know the first picture fails to display when you check this file on github, but it works on my website.
and the second is directly uploaded to this file, which works well as usual.
