Even thoug it doesn't look very tasty, it is really delicious especially when you eat it with rice.
Cookbook:
1. Peel the eggplant and "spread" it like this:

In this way the dish won't look that messy.
2. Then steam the eggplant for about 15 min.
3. As for the sauce, there are two versions:
   _ **For the light version,**
     soy sauce                        2 spoons
     oyster sauce                     1 spoon
     _rice wine_                      _1 spoon_
     dark soy sauce                   1 spoon (or less)
     honey                            1 spoon
     white sugar, salt                depends
     Starch water                     1 bowl
   _ **For the heavy flavor version,**
     soy sauce                        2 spoons
     oyster sauce                     1 spoon
     dark soy sauce                   1 spoon (or less)
     honey                            1 spoon
     white sugar, salt                depends
     **Coca Cola (NO PEPSI, thanks!)  1 bowl**
4. Fry the eggplants until they turn burnt yellow (I haven't succeeded frying eggplants into this color, maybe I should add more oil?).
5. Add the sauce into the pan, and stew it for some time over high heat to thicken the sauce.
6. FINISHED
