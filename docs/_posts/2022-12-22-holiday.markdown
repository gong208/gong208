<br>
Heavy snow covered the fields in Denvor!

First night at Vail Resort. It was fantastic with all neon lights glowing.

# Practicing on introductory skiing skills
*2022.12.17*
<br>
Since I'd skied for once before, I mastered the "snow plough" pretty quickly.
>  snow plough is a elementary skiing skill. It helps to slow down by pushing the back of both skis out, or make a turn by pushing the back of one of the skis.

# Learning higher level skills and "adventure" in the mountain
*2022.12.18~2022.12.21*
To be able to ski on steeper slopes, I had to learn the "parallel turning", which would slow down and turn more effectively.
I practiced on a relatively gentle slope for two days.
Here are some tips:

1. Put most of the weight of the body **forward** (downhill) so that the body won't fall to the slope;
2. While making a parallel turn, put more weight on the ski downhill, it is then easier to make the ski uphill parallel to the one downhill.
3. Look forward and make sure that you cannot see the tips of your skis, or your weight may be lagging behind, leading to a fall.

On 2022.12.21, I rode the chairlift to a top of the mountain and skied all the way down. There were some slip-overs but I did feel a sense of achievement!
