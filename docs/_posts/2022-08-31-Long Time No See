Hey there, it has been a month since I updated my posts. In the past month I struggled with all those troublesome stuffs emerging at the beginning of the campus life in UIUC.
~~Actually I am still struggling with them now~~
So much for the complaints, I've enrolled in the cs124 honor course besides the cs124. These two classes are in fact not correlated at all. The cs124honor is mainly held by a group of senior students.
And no credit hour is got from this course. What I can get is, basically, well, honor? 
All in all, they are training us with bash and git for future projects.
I learned bash this week and luckily found that it was just like how the terminal in Linus OS worked.
Here are some notes:
1. `touch file.ext` is used for creating a file. The type of the file depends on the estension you give.
2. `echo "string"` and `echo "string" > file.ext` The first command prints the content in the string in a new line, and the second one prints the string into the fil. Using the ">" redirect sign, you can write the string directly into the file through terminal, but ">" will delete the original content and ">>" won't 
3. `cat file.ext` print the content in the file to the terminal
I think these are things to be noticed during my bash learning. So much for that.
